Hosts
=====

This is a little client/server to collect hardware informations from clients
and make the information available on a website.
Note the port and the password for the encryption are hard-wired into 
the code. This should be changed!
Hosts are deleted from the list when no updates are sent for too long.

This is program is just a little test and it is insecure. Never use it!
